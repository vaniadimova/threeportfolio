      <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Creator, Thinker & Problem Solver</h3>
     
      <p>
         I <b>love crithical thinking</b>  Understanding, application and evaluation of information gained from 
         observation or experience
          or generated by reflection and/or communication as a guide to belief or action;
           a guide to decision making.
      </p>

      <p>
        I  <b>believe</b> in the idea of the ideal society, is an integral part of political theory. 
        It is concerned with the critique of existing society and its improvement. We all have a utopian side to our brains, which we are normally careful to disguise, for fear of humiliation. 
        Yet, our visions are what carve out the space in which later patient and real development can occur.

      “No one on earth can do what you do… in precisely the way that you do it.”

        I am a <b>self-thought</b> web developer. Identifying priorities allows for the flexibility 
        to adjust to changing requirements in any given situation. Being a natural problem solver
         with a diverse set of relevant skills and assets enables me to meet deadlines, pay attention to detail, 
         and ensure that any given task is completed.<br></p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <hr>
     <p>🚵🏼‍♀️What I do when I am not coding? 
      Gardening 🎋 
      I believe in green planet survival and that we as individuals play a role of huge importance. 
      Growing your own food has numerous health benefits, including: It encourages you to eat more
       fresh fruits and vegetables. You get to choose which fertilisers and pesticides come into contact with your food. 
       Garden-ripened vegetables contain more nutrients than store-bought vegetables that must be picked early.
Biking and swimming are my favorite outdoor sports.
